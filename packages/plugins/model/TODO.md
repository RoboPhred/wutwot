## TODO

- Find a better name for this plugin.

- Currently, this just exposes a name and location property. It should instead offer a hierarchy of things, and allow for creating container things tagged as Rooms and Buildings.

- Would be nice if the name property we emit could be used as the thing title. Maybe let plugins define providers for thing titles and descriptions
